## Project Abstract
In this project we are asked to develop a configurable and buildable C-code library for generic RST digital controller. also simulate the closed loop control on a simulator or evaluation board.
User should be able to configure process discrete model and desired tracking and regulation performance. we also developed a calculation engine tool that design the correct structure and parameters of the RST controller. Then, generates the proper library runnable on target.
